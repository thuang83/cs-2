# EventFindr

Answer these:

1. What is your hack and why did you do it? What is its social impact?
	Our hack, HOWDYdo, is a social event finder. It allows people to network and become more involved in their community. HOWDYdo lists upcoming Facebook events connected to the user and pins their locations on a map.   
2. Explain the technical details of your hack.
	HOWDYdo draws event information from the user's Facebook account. This extracts event names and locations through the Facebook API and plots them on a Google map. HOWDYdo also generates a list of links to the event pages on Facebook.
3. What did you learn and how do you want to expand upon your idea in the future?
	As first-time web dev programmers, we spent a large portion of our time learning the basics of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. However, we were able to draw parallels between MATLAB and JavaScript and apply that knowledge to our code. For example, the same logic used in parsing data with structures in MATLAB was applicable to parsing data from objects in JavaScript. Ru Yi learned how to interface with Facebook API and gained a familiarity with we also learned about creating UI through HTML. Much of what we learned was from the help of fellow coders and mentors. 
	If we were given more time, we would like to include other events in the user's network.
	We would also improve the integration with Google Maps by including a pop-up when an event marker is clicked, linking the user to the facebook page. There would also be an option to limit listed events within a certain distance from the user.
